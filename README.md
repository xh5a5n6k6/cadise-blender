# Cadise-Blender

## Introduction
This repository maintains blender exporter for cadise. It takes some other renderer-blender-addons ([Photon-v2-blender](https://github.com/TzuChieh/Photon-v2/tree/develop/BlenderAddon), [SORT-blender](https://github.com/JerryCao1985/SORT/tree/master/blender-plugin/2.8/sortblend), [Mitsuba-blender](https://github.com/beltegeuse/mitsuba-blender), etc) as references.

It only supports Blender 2.80 and higher.

## Support Features
- Mesh (triangle-mesh)
- Light (point light, square / rectangle area light)

Material part (including node system) is still in progress, so it currently needs to setup material manually.
